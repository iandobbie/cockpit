Cockpit is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and can be
`installed like any other Python package
<https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/>`__.  The
short version of it is::

    pip install microscope-cockpit


Once installed, cockpit can be started from command line::

    cockpit

If you just want to try it out this is the easiest way, but for details on dependencies, system specific instructions, configuration and
installing from development sources see `doc/install.rst <doc/install.rst>`__.
