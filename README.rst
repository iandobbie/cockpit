Cockpit is a microscope graphical user interface.  It is a flexible
and easy to extend platform aimed at life scientists using bespoke
microscopes. More detailed information is available:

- in the recently published `bioRxiv paper <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427178v1>`__

- on the `Webpage <https://micronoxford.com/python-microscope-cockpit>`__

- in the `Docs <https://www.micron.ox.ac.uk/software/cockpit/install.html>`__

Main Features
--------------

- **Easy to use and extend by life scientists:**  Cockpit is completely
  written in Python and meant to be extended by the user.

- **Independent of the actual devices being used:**  Cockpit uses Python's
  `Microscope package <https://www.python-microscope.org>`__ to
  control the devices.  The graphical interface and experiments
  automatically adjust to the existing devices.

- **Very fast device control and time precision:**  During experiments,
  devices are controlled via hardware signals.

- **Cross Platform:**  Cockpit can run on GNU/Linux, Mac, and Windows.

- **FOSS:** Cockpit is free and open source software, released under the GPL.


The User Interface
------------------

The user interface is made up of a number of windows with the main
ones shown below.
